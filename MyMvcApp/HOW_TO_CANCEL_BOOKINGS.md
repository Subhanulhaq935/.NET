## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Only pending or accepted bookings can be cancelled"
- **Solution**: You're trying to cancel a booking that's already completed or cancelled. Check the booking status first.

### "Cannot cancel a booking that has already passed"
- **Solution**: The booking date/time has already passed. You can only cancel future bookings.

### Cancel button not showing
- **Check**: Make sure you're logged in as the correct user (Customer or Provider)
- **Check**: Verify the booking status is "Pending" or "Accepted"
- **Check**: Ensure the booking date/time hasn't passed

## 💡 Tips

1. **For Customers**: If you need to cancel, do it as soon as possible so the provider can free up their schedule
2. **For Providers**: If you need to cancel, consider contacting the customer first if possible
3. **Both**: Cancelled bookings remain in your history for reference
